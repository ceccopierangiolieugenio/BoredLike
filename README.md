Boring Dungeon Roguelike

Try it and get bored to death:

## Intro

* Roguelikes could be boring.
* Procedural generation is often boring.
* The immortal nature of an NPC can lead him to wish a quick and not always painless death.

**You** are the hero responsible to free them from their torments.

## Idea (behind)

This is my first roguelike and a personal exercise on procedural quests generation.

My only scope is to explore the different ways to generate quests. Starting from a simple "Bring me obj." to more complex and nested tasks.

The leat possible effort will be used for fancy graphics/map generation (unless required for some specific quests).

Everyone can be killed at any time and there are plenty of quests. All of them need to be completed or partially solved in a specific order in order to achieve the maximum score. (i.e., someone want the only apple tree burned and someone else want an apple from that tree)
