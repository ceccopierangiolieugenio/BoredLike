Roguelikes could be boring.
Procedural generation is often boring.
The immortal nature of an NPC can lead him to wish a quick and 
not always painless death.

You are the hero responsible to free them from their torments.

SCOPE:
The main scope of this roguelike is to explore the different ways to
generate quests.
Starting from a simple "Bring me obj." to more complex and nested tasks.

Everyone can be killed at any time, everyone have unsolved quests.
All of them need to be solved or partially completed in a specific order
in order to achieve the maximum score.
(i.e., someone want an apple from a tree and someone else want that tree
destroyed)

IDEAS:

Gain exp. by killing people and improve skills (carry heavy obj).
Discover areas with explosion.
Dig?

Quests:
Bring object to.
   Get Apple from tree.
Cut Tree.
Kill someone.
Deliver message.
   (Tell him I love him, reply I love her, we can die happily together)
